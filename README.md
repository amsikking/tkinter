# tkinter
Some simple (re-usable) modules for quickly creating a hardware GUI.
## Quick start:
- Run 'tkinter_compound_widgets.py' to see (and interact with) a grab bag of compound widgets that can be used to make a simple yet effective graphical user interface (GUI).
- Run 'microscope_gui_example.py' to see (and interact with) a simulated microscope that is closely based on a functioning microscope.
## Details:
- If you're new to tkinter check out the 'basics' folder that demystifies some of what's going on behind the scenes with a collection of primitive
examples.
- Once you've got the hang of the 'basics' check out the 'widgets' folder which show some of the more popular GUI elements in action.
- The 'tkinter_compound_widgets.py' module is intended to be one stop import for builders who simply want a fast and convenient way to make hardware
 GUI's in Python (aiming to reduce code re-write and bloat when making a simple GUI).
